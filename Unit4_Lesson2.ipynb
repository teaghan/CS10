    "# Variables, Expressions and Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A\n",
    "variable is a name that refers to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are a fundamental concept in programming, and they are used to store and manipulate values\n",
    "or data. They are like containers that can hold different types of information, such as numbers, text, or\n",
    "logical values, and allow programmers to perform complex operations on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are important in programming because they enable flexibility and efficiency in code. They allow\n",
    "programmers to store and manipulate data dynamically, meaning that the same code can be reused for\n",
    "different data inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, imagine you are writing a program to calculate the area of a rectangle. Instead of hard-coding the values of the length and width of the rectangle into the code, you can use variables to store these values and calculate the area based on the variable values. This allows you to easily change the dimensions of the rectangle without having to modify the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables also allow for better organization of code. By giving variables meaningful names, programmers\n",
    "can make their code more readable and easier to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    ">For example, instead of using a generic name like \"num1\" for a variable that stores a number, a programmer could use a more descriptive name like \"user_age\" or \"total_score\" to convey the purpose of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, variables are important in programming because they allow for flexibility, efficiency, and\n",
    "organization of code. They enable programmers to store and manipulate data dynamically, which makes\n",
    "their code more adaptable and reusable."

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a named container that stores a value. Think of it like a box with a label on it, where you can put something inside and then use the label to refer to it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you want to store the number 5 in a variable called `my_number`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a notebook in Deepnote and define this variable in a code cell:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_number = 5\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, whenever you want to use the number 5 in your program, you can just refer to it using\n",
    "the variable name `my_number`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output `my_number` to the screen by entering the following code into another code cell:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "print(my_number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It should have output the number 5 to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can hold many different types of values in Python, including numbers, strings, and\n",
    "even more complex data structures like lists and dictionaries. By using variables, you can make\n",
    "your code more readable and easier to manage, since you can refer to values by name rather\n",
    "than hardcoding them into your code."

    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "- Semantic errors\n",

    "It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Error:** Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure.\n",

    "error.\n",

    "programming career, you might spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain\n",
    "experience, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime error:** The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does\n",
    "not appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called **exceptions**\n",
    "because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few lessons, so it might\n",
    "be a while before you encounter one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic error:** The third type of error is “semantic”, which means related to meaning. If there\n",
    "is a semantic error in your program, it ill run without generating error messages, but it will not\n",
    "do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it ill do what you told it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at\n",
    "the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.\n",
