Ultimately, the best programming language for you depends on what you’re looking to achieve.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the programming language you will learn in this unit is Python. Python is an example of a high-level language; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C, C++, Perl, and Java.\n\nThere are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “assembly languages.” Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in low level languages. So, programs written in a high-level language must be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high- level languages.\n\n![high_vs_low_level](images/high_vs_low_level.png)\n\nHowever, **the advantages of high-level languages are enormous**:\n\n- First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high- level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct.\n- Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.\nDue to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low level languages are used only for a few specialized applications. Two kinds of programs process high- level languages into low-level languages: **interpreters** and **compilers**.","block_group":"27b370fcc0e8435690ce6fbd6eb1ec37"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"724356dcc90e45f9a50436a9a79723ba","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### Interpreters and Compilers\n\nAn **interpreter** reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says.

The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or playing a video.\n\nThe details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:\n\n- **Input:** Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device. \n- **Output:** Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc. \n- **Math:** Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication. \n- **Conditional Execution:** Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code. \n- **Repetition:** Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\n\nBelieve it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to programming. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these.\n\nYou can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions.","block_group":"4829f43aacb042b28e9dc5cb854f69ad"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"01fae501ab914bbf92c9ecfa82854370","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## Interactive Development Environment\n\nWhen you write a program, in any programming language, you usually type your code into an Interactive Development Environment or IDE for short.

They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.\n\n**Formal Languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols.Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly, programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.\n\nFormal languages tend to have strict **syntax** rules that govern the structure of statements. For example, in mathematics the statement `3 + 3 = 6` has correct syntax, but `3 + = 3$6` does not. In chemistry $H_20$ is a syntactically correct formula, but $_2Zz$ is not.\n\nSyntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to **tokens** and **structure**.\n\n**Tokens** are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with `3 + = 3$6` is that `$` is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I know). Similarly, $_2Zz$ is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation $Zz$.\n\n> *Ex: This is @ well-structured Engli$h sentence with invalid t\\*kens in it.*\n\nThe second type of syntax rule pertains to the **structure** of a statement; that is, the way the tokens are arranged.

Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before.\n\n> *Ex: This sentence all valid tokens has, but invalid structure with.*\n\nWhen you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously).

Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many activities beyond programming.\n\n# Glossary\n\nIn this lesson, I introduced a lot of new terms, and it can get confusing. This list may help you to understand these terms. Please read it carefully.\n\n* algorithm: A general process for solving a category of problems.\n* bug: An error in a program.\n* compile: To translate a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution.\n* debugging: The process of finding and removing any of the three kinds of programming errors.\n* executable: Another name for object code that is ready to be executed.\n* formal language: Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs; all programming languages are formal languages.\n\n* high-level language: A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.\n* interactive mode: A way of using the Python interpreter by typing commands and expressions at the prompt.\n* interpret: To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time.\n* low-level language: A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute; also called “machine language” or “assembly language.”\n* natural language: Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.\n* object code: The output of the compiler after it translates the program.\n* parse: To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.\n* print: A function that causes the Python interpreter to display a value on the screen.\n* problem solving: The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and expressing the solution.\n* program: A set of instructions that specifies a computation.\n* prompt: Characters displayed by the interpreter to indicate that it is ready to take input from the user.\n* script: A program stored in a file (usually one that will be interpreted).\n\n* script mode: A way of using the Python interpreter to read and execute statements in a script.\n* semantics: The meaning of a program.\n* semantic error: An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.\n* source code: A program in a high-level language before being compiled.\n* syntax: The structure of a program.\n* syntax error: An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse (and therefore impossible to interpret).\n* token: One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a natural language.","block_group":"ad9c1d04995243848b117900998d8ac2"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"52dbbac70fb94654a338efd3c12c7fb6","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### (optional) Installing Python and JupyterLab locally\n\nIf you happen to want to install Python on your own computer (**which is not a requirement**), go to www.python.org and select the Download link.
