Needless to say, programming languages have evolved tremendously.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are hundreds of programming languages, each with their own unique strengths and applications. Ultimately, the best programming language for you depends on what you’re looking to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned earlier, the programming language you will learn in this unit is Python. Python is an example of a high-level language; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C, C++, Perl, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “assembly languages.” Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in low level languages. So, programs written in a high-level language must be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high- level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "![high_vs_low_level](images/high_vs_low_level.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **the advantages of high-level languages are enormous**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high- level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct.\n",
    "- Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.\n",
    "Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low level languages are used only for a few specialized applications. Two kinds of programs process high- level languages into low-level languages: **interpreters** and **compilers**."

    "\n",
    "- **Input:** Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device. \n",
    "- **Output:** Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc. \n",
    "- **Math:** Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication. \n",

    "- **Repetition:** Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\n",

    "# Formal and Natural Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Languages** are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols.Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly, programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal languages tend to have strict **syntax** rules that govern the structure of statements. For example, in mathematics the statement `3 + 3 = 6` has correct syntax, but `3 + = 3$6` does not. In chemistry $H_20$ is a syntactically correct formula, but $_2Zz$ is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to **tokens** and **structure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokens** are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with `3 + = 3$6` is that `$` is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I know). Similarly, $_2Zz$ is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation $Zz$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Ex: This is @ well-structured Engli$h sentence with invalid t\\*kens in it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of syntax rule pertains to the **structure** of a statement; that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement `3+ = 3` is illegal because even though `+` and `=` are legal tokens, you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Ex: This sentence all valid tokens has, but invalid structure with.*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called **parsing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics—there are some differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n",
    "* Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "* Formal languages mean exactly what they say.\n",
    "* Finally, the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get\n",
    "away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.\n",
