    "*By completing these challenges, you'll demonstrate that you understand key programming concepts.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the `Challenge 25.ipynb` file and upload it into your own *Project* on Deepnote by dragging the `Challenge 25.ipynb` file onto the Notebooks tab on the left-hand side. This will give you a file to organize your code and provide your answers to the reflection questions. Once you are finished, you can download your notebook and embed it within your portfolio for safe keeping. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you’ll be writing **FOUR programs** to demonstrate your understanding of conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also **answer all the reflection questions** at the end of this challenge on this post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use full sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’ve finished the challenge, call me over to read it and sign off on it. I’ll also want to run your programs, so make sure the notebook runs properly.\n",

    "Below I’ve given you nine different problems. **Please choose FOUR to complete**.\n",

    "Don’t forget to use comments appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some of these programs, you will need to generate a random number. You can generate a\n",
    "pseudorandom number in Python using the `random` module and the `randint()` function. (You’ll\n",
    "learn about modules and functions soon!) Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random\n",
    "because they are generated by a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers\n",
    "it is all but impossible to distinguish them from random. Below is some example code.\n",

    "1. **Guess the Number Game:** Write a program that generates a random number between 1\n",
    "and 100 and asks the user to guess it. If the user's guess is too high, the program should\n",
    "print \"Too high\" and if the guess is too low, the program should print \"Too low\". The\n",
    "program should continue asking the user for guesses until they correctly guess the\n",
    "number.\n",
    "2. **Magic 8-Ball:** Write a program that simulates a Magic 8-Ball, which is a toy used for\n",
    "fortune-telling. The program should ask the user to ask a yes or no question, then\n",
    "randomly choose one of eight possible answers and print it out.\n",
    "3. **Rock-Paper-Scissors:** Write a program that allows the user to play a game of rock-paper-\n",
    "scissors against the computer. The program should randomly choose one of the three\n",
    "options and compare it to the user's choice. If the user wins, the program should print\n",
    "\"You win!\", if the computer wins, the program should print \"Computer wins!\", and if it's\n",
    "a tie, the program should print \"It's a tie!\".\n",
    "4. **Zodiac Sign Predictor:** Write a program that asks the user for their birth month and day\n",
    "and uses conditionals to determine their zodiac sign. The program should then print out\n",
    "a made-up horoscope or personality description for that sign.\n",
    "5. **Password Checker:** Write a program that asks the user to enter a password, and then\n",
    "uses conditionals to check if the password meets certain criteria (such as length,\n",
    "complexity, etc.). If the password meets the criteria, the program should print\n",
    "\"Password accepted\", otherwise it should print \"Password rejected\" and give the user\n",
    "suggestions for how to improve their password.\n",
    "6. **Mad Libs:** Write a program that prompts the user to enter a series of words (such as\n",
    "nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) and then uses conditionals to construct a silly story using\n",
    "those words. For example, the program might ask for a noun and then insert it into the\n",
    "sentence \"The `[noun]` jumped over the moon\".\n",
    "7. **Temperature Converter:** Write a program that allows the user to convert between\n",
    "Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures. The program should ask the user to enter a\n",
    "temperature and a unit of measurement, and then use conditionals to convert the\n",
    "temperature to the other unit.\n",
    "8. **Hangman:** Write a program that allows the user to play a game of Hangman, where they\n",
    "try to guess a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. The program should choose\n",
    "a random word from a list, and then ask the user to guess a letter. If the letter is in the\n",
    "word, the program should reveal its position in the word, otherwise it should draw a\n",
    "part of a hangman's gallows.\n",
    "9. **Choose Your Own Adventure Game:** Write a program that allows the user to play a\n",
    "text-based adventure game, where they make choices that determine the outcome of\n",
    "the story. The program should present the user with a series of options, and then use\n",
    "conditionals to determine what happens next based on their choices.\n",

    "## Reflection Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Please answer these questions in markdown cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What did you learn in the process of completing the challenge?\n",
    "2. What went well?\n",
    "3. What did not go as planned? What did you struggle with?\n",
    "4. What will you do differently in the next challenge? What do you want to get better at?\n",
