    "*By completing these challenges, you'll demonstrate that you understand key programming concepts.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you’ll be writing **FOUR programs** to demonstrate your understanding of conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each challenge, you can either write your code in this notebook in the provided code cells **or** write the programs into individual scripts to operate in script mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use Markdown cells to **answer all the reflection questions** at the end of this challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’ve finished the challenge, call me over to read it and sign off on it. I’ll also want to run your programs, so make sure the notebook runs properly!\n",

    "## Random numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In some of these programs, you will need to generate a random number. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate a\n",
    "pseudorandom number in Python using the `random` module and the `randint()` function. (You’ll\n",
    "learn about modules and functions soon!) Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random\n",
    "because they are generated by a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers\n",
    "it is all but impossible to distinguish them from random. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is some example code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Program to generate random numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "# Import the random module\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate a pseudorandom number between 0 and 9\n",
    "x = random.randint(0,9)\n",
