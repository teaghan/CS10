    "## Why and When to use `while` loop in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the question might arise: when do we use a **`while`** loop, and why do we use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automate and repeat tasks:** As we know, **`while`** loops execute blocks of code over and over again until the condition is met it allows us to automate and repeat tasks in an efficient manner.\n",
    "* **Indefinite Iteration:**The **`while`** loop will run as often as necessary to complete a particular task. When the user doesn’t know the number of iterations before execution, **`while`** loop is used instead of a **[for loop](https://github.com/milaan9/03_Python_Flow_Control/blob/main/005_Python_for_Loop.ipynb)** loop\n",
    "* **Reduce complexity:** **`while`** loop is easy to write. using the loop, we don’t need to write the statements again and again. Instead, we can write statements we wanted to execute again and again inside the body of the loop thus, reducing the complexity of the code\n",
    "* **Infinite loop:** If the code inside the **`while`** loop doesn’t modify the variables being tested in the loop condition, the loop will run forever."
