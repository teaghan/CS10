    "## Nested Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a nested conditional is a conditional statement that is embedded within another\n",
    "conditional statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nested conditional is used when we need to check for more than one condition and the\n",
    "outcome of one condition depends on the outcome of another condition. By embedding one\n",
    "conditional inside another, we can create more complex decision-making structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Try the following lines of code in your notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = input('Enter a value for x: ')\n",
    "y = input('Enter a value for y: ')\n",
    "\n",
    "if x < y:\n",
    "    print('x is less than y')\n",
    "elif:\n",
    "    if x == y:\n",
    "        print('x is equal to y')\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print('x is greater than y')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a nested conditional. The outer if statement checks whether `x` is less\n",
    "than `y`. If this condition is `True`, then the program will execute the indented block of code under\n",
    "the `if` statement, which prints `\"x is less than y\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the condition in the outer if statement is `False`, then the program will move on to the inner `if`\n",
    "statement. Here, the program checks whether `x is equal to y`. If this condition is `True`, then the\n",
    "program will execute the indented block of code under the inner if statement, which prints `\"x is\n",
    "equal to y\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both conditions are `False`, then the program will execute the code under the `else` block, which\n",
    "prints `\"x is greater than y\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each conditional statement in a nested conditional must be indented to indicate\n",
    "which block of code belongs to which conditional. In this example, the block of code under the\n",
    "outer `if` statement is indented more than the block of code under the inner `if` statement,\n",
    "indicating that the inner `if` statement is embedded within the outer if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, **nested conditionals**\n",
    "become difficult to read very quickly. It is a good idea to avoid them when you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements. For example,\n",
    "we could rewrite the following program using a single conditional:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 0 < x:\n",
    "    if x < 10:\n",
    "        print('x is a positive single-digit number.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print` statement runs only if we make it past both conditionals, so we can get the same\n",
    "effect with the `and` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 0 < x and if x < 10:\n",
    "        print('x is a positive single-digit number.')\n",
