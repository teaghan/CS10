    "## Incremental Development\n",
    "\n",
    "As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called **incremental\n",
    "development**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by\n",
    "adding and testing only a small amount of ode at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">For example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given by the coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is: $distance = \\sqrt{(x_2− x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "> The first step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Python – what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Immediately you can write an outline of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. In your notebook, create a function with the following code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n",
    "    # Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)\n",
    "    # this function will return the distance\n",
    "    # between them\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return 0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it runs which means that you can test it before you make it more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Add a function call below your function and a print statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dist = distance(1, 2, 4, 6)\n",
    "print(dist)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** I chose the arguments (1, 2, 4, 6) so that the horizontal distance is 3, the vertical distance is 4; and the distance between the two points is 5. When testing a function, it is very useful to know the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we’ve confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start adding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to fid the differences $x_2-x_1$ and $y_2-y_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next version of the program stores these values in temporary variables and prints them:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Edit your function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n",
    "    # Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)\n",
    "    # this function will return the distance\n",
    "    # between them\n",
    "    \n",
    "    dx = x2 - x1\n",
    "    dy = y2 - y1\n",
    "    print('dx is ', dx)\n",
    "    print('dy is ', dy)\n",
    "    return 0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Call your function. The output should be:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dx is 3\n",
    "dy is 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the output is what you expect it to be, we know that the function is getting the right arguments and performing the first computation correctly. If not, there are just a few lines to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’ll compute the sum of squares of `dx` and `dy`\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Edit your function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n",
    "    # Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)\n",

    "    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2\n",
    "    print('dsquared is ', dsquared)\n",
    "    return 0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Call your function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should get 25. Again, if you didn’t, there are only a few lines of code where the\n",
    "problem could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’ll use the math module and math.sqrt to compute and return the result\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Edit your code so that it uses the the math module and `math.sqrt`:**\n",

    "    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2\n",
    "    result = math.sqrt(dsquared)\n",
    "    print('result)\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Call your function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If it works correctly, you’re almost done. The final version of the function shouldn’t display anything when it runs; it should only return a value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `print` statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you should remove them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code like that is called **scaffolding** because it is helpful for building the program, but is not part of the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time. As you get more experienced programming, you might fid yourself writing and debugging bigger chunks of code. Either way, incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key aspects of Incremental Debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.\n",
    "- Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.\n",
    "- Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to read."
