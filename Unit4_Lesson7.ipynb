    "\n",
    "There are numerous methods available with the string object. The **`format()`** method that we mentioned above is one of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can be tranformed by a variety of functions that are all methods on a string. That is they are called by putting the function name with a **`.`** after the string. They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Upper vs lower case: **`upper()`**, **`lower()`**, **`captialize()`**, **`title()`** and **`swapcase()`**, **`join()`**, **`split()`**, **`find()`**, **`replace()`** etc, with mostly the obvious meaning. Note that `capitalize` makes the first letter of the string a capital only, while **`title`** selects upper case for the first letter of every word.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Padding strings: **`center(n)`**, **`ljust(n)`** and **`rjust(n)`** each place the string into a longer string of length n  padded by spaces (centered, left-justified or right-justified respectively). **`zfill(n)`** works similarly but pads with leading zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stripping strings: Often we want to remove spaces, this is achived with the functions **`strip()`**, **`lstrip()`**, and **`rstrip()`** respectively to remove from spaces from the both end, just left or just the right respectively. An optional argument can be used to list a set of other characters to be removed.\n",

    "When you write code professionally, you write it for two primary audiences: your users and developers (including yourself). Both audiences are equally important. If you’re like me, you’ve probably opened up old programs and wondered to yourself, “What in the world was I thinking?” \n",

However, when you start using the library, you look for examples, write-ups, or even official documentation on how to do something specific and can’t immediately find the solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "—- Jeff Atwood (aka Coding Horror)\n",

    "**Documenting** code is describing its use and functionality to your users. While it may be helpful in the development process, the main intended audience is the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you already know, comments are created in Python using the pound sign (#) and should be brief statements no longer than a few sentences. If a comment is going to be greater than 72 characters, using multiple lines for the comment is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "def calc_hypotenuse(a, b):\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# First step\n",
    "# Second step\n",
    "# Third step\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Description:** Comments can be used to explain the intent of specific sections of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Attempt a connection based on previous settings. If unsuccessful, prompt user for new settings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic Description:** When algorithms are used, especially complicated ones, it can be useful to explain how the algorithm works or how it’s implemented within your code. It may also be appropriate to describe why a specific algorithm was selected over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using a quick sort for performance gains\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tagging:** The use of tagging can be used to label specific sections of code where known issues or areas of improvement are located. Some examples are: BUG, FIXME, and TODO.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# TODO: add condition for when val is None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

When you design your code using clear, easy-to-understand concepts, the reader will be able to quickly conceptualize your intent.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, we used the `help()` function to get information about the built-in abs() function in Python. The docstring for `abs()` tells us that it returns the absolute value of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docstrings** are enclosed in triple quotes (`\"\"\" \"\"\"` or `''' '''`) and are considered part of the code.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You probably noticed that the docstring in the example above was multi-lined.\n",
    "\n",
    "All function docstrings should have the following parts:\n",
    "- A one-line summary line\n",
    "- A blank line proceeding the summary\n",
    "- What parameter it takes (with its type)\n",
    "- Another blank line\n",
    "- What it returns (with its type)\n",

    "The main difference between commenting and documenting your code is that comments are\n",

    "complex lines of code, while docstrings are used to document entire functions, modules, and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, commenting is useful for providing short explanations of specific lines of code, while documenting is useful for providing more detailed explanations of entire functions, modules, and classes. Both commenting and documenting your code are important practices to help other developers understand your code and make it easier to maintain and update in the future."
