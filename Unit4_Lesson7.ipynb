    "## Common Python String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can be tranformed by a variety of functions that are all \"methods\" of a string. To call a method on a string, you follow the string with a **`.`** then the function name. Some string methods include include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Changing the case of your string: **`upper()`**, **`lower()`**, **`captialize()`**, **`title()`** and **`swapcase()`**,\n",
    "    - Note that `capitalize` makes the first letter of the string a capital only, while **`title`** selects upper case for the first letter of every word.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some really useful ones: **`join()`**, **`split()`**, **`find()`**, and **`replace()`** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Padding strings: **`center(n)`**, **`ljust(n)`** and **`rjust(n)`** each place the string into a longer string of length n  padded by spaces (centered, left-justified or right-justified respectively). **`zfill(n)`** works similarly but pads with leading zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stripping strings: Often we want to remove spaces, this is achived with the functions **`strip()`**, **`lstrip()`**, and **`rstrip()`** respectively to remove from spaces from the both end, just left or just the right respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a complete list of all the **[built-in methods to work with Strings in Python](https://github.com/milaan9/02_Python_Datatypes/tree/main/002_Python_String_Methods)**."

However, when you start using the library, you look for examples, write-ups, or even official documentation on how to do something specific and can’t immediately find the solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you already know, comments are created in Python using the pound sign (#) and should be brief statements no longer than a few sentences. If a comment is going to be greater than 72 characters, using multiple lines for the comment is appropriate.\n",

    "\n",

    "# First step\n",
    "# Second step\n",

    "# Attempt a connection based on previous settings. If unsuccessful, prompt user for new settings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic Description:** When algorithms are used, especially complicated ones, it can be useful to explain how the algorithm works or how it’s implemented within your code. It may also be appropriate to describe why a specific algorithm was selected over another.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Using a quick sort for performance gains\n",
    "```\n",
