    "## 1. Opening Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in **`open()`** function to open a file. This function returns a file object, also called a handle, as it is used to read or modify the file accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> f = open(\"test.txt\")  # open file in current directory\n",
    ">>> f = open(\"C:/Python99/README.txt\")   # specifying full path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can specify the mode while opening a file. In mode, we specify whether we want to read **`r`**, write **`w`** or append **`a`** to the file. We can also specify if we want to open the file in text mode or binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default is reading in text mode. In this mode, we get strings when reading from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, binary mode returns bytes and this is the mode to be used when dealing with non-text files like images or executable files.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description |\n",
    "|:----:| :--- |\n",
    "| **`r`** | **Read** -Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.   | \n",
    "| **`t`** | **Text** - Opens in text mode. (default).   | \n",
    "| **`b`** | **Binary** - Opens in binary mode (e.g. images).  | \n",
    "| **`x`** | **Create** - Opens a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.   | \n",
    "| **`rb`** | Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.   | \n",
    "| **`r+`** | Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.   | \n",
    "| **`rb+`** | Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.   |  \n",
    "| **`w`** | **Write** - Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.   | \n",
    "| **`wb`** | Opens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.   | \n",

    "| **`ab`** | Opens a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.   | \n",

    "| **`close()`** |   Closes an opened file. It has no effect if the file is already closed.   | \n",
    "| **`detach()`** |   Separates the underlying binary buffer from the **`TextIOBase`** and returns it.   | \n",
    "| **`fileno()`** |   Returns an integer number (file descriptor) of the file.   | \n",
    "| **`flush()`** |   Flushes the write buffer of the file stream.   | \n",
    "| **`isatty()`** |   Returns **`True`** if the file stream is interactive.   | \n",
    "| **`read(n)`** |   Reads at most `n` characters from the file. Reads till end of file if it is negative or `None`.   | \n",
    "| **`readable()`** |   Returns **`True`** if the file stream can be read from.   | \n",
    "| **`readline(n=-1)`** |   Reads and returns one line from the file. Reads in at most **`n`** bytes if specified.   | \n",
    "| **`readlines(n=-1)`** |   Reads and returns a list of lines from the file. Reads in at most **`n`** bytes/characters if specified.   | \n",
    "| **`seek(offset,from=SEEK_SET)`** |   Changes the file position to **`offset`** bytes, in reference to `from` (start, current, end).   | \n",
    "| **`seekable()`** |   Returns **`True`** if the file stream supports random access.   | \n",
    "| **`tell()`** |   Returns the current file location.   | \n",
    "| **`truncate(size=None)`** |   Resizes the file stream to **`size`** bytes. If **`size`** is not specified, resizes to current location..   | \n",
    "| **`writable()`** |   Returns **`True`** if the file stream can be written to.   | \n",
    "| **`write(s)`** |   Writes the string **`s`** to the file and returns the number of characters written..   | \n",
    "| **`writelines(lines)`** |   Writes a list of **`lines`** to the file..   | "
